## Hi there I am Michalis 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I am an information engineer by training (B.Sc. in Information Engineering), with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing on data assimilation (DA) and variational 
Bayesian algorithms. More broadly, my research interests lie in the area of probabilistic machine learning. I also enjoy implementing and prototyping non-trivial 
numerical algorithms.

- 🔭 Currently Scientific Researcher at ICAR-CNR working on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) problems.
- 📝 You can find my research articles on my [website](https://vrettasm.weebly.com/publications).
- 🌟 The **PyGeneticAlgorithms** code is now available!
